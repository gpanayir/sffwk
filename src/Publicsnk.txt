 Options:
  -c [<csp>]
    Set/reset the name of the CSP to use for MSCORSN operations.
  -d <container>
    Delete key container named <container>.
  -D <assembly1> <assembly2>
    Verify <assembly1> and <assembly2> differ only by signature.
  -e <assembly> <outfile>
    Extract public key from <assembly> into <outfile>.
  -i <infile> <container>
    Install key pair from <infile> into a key container named <container>.
  -k [<keysize>] <outfile>
    Generate a new key pair of the specified size and write it into <outfile>.
  -m [y|n]
    Enable (y), disable (n) or check (no parameter) whether key containers
    are machine specific (rather than user specific).
  -o <infile> [<outfile>]
    Convert public key in <infile> to text file <outfile> with comma separated
    list of decimal byte values.
    If <outfile> is omitted, text is copied to clipboard instead.
  -p <infile> <outfile>
    Extract public key from key pair in <infile> and export to <outfile>.
  -pc <container> <outfile>
    Extract public key from key pair in <container> and export to <outfile>.
  -q
    Quiet mode. This option must be first on the command line and will suppress
    any output other than error messages.
  -R[a] <assembly> <infile>
    Re-sign signed or partially signed assembly with the key pair in <infile>.
    If -Ra is used, hashes are recomputed for all files in the assembly.
  -Rc[a] <assembly> <container>
    Re-sign signed or partially signed assembly with the key pair in the key
    container named <container>.
    If -Rca is used, hashes are recomputed for all files in the assembly.
  -Rh <assembly>
    Re-compute hashes for all files in the assembly.
  -t[p] <infile>
    Display token for public key in <infile> (together with the public key
    itself if -tp is used).
  -T[p] <assembly>
    Display token for public key of <assembly> (together with the public key
    itself if -Tp is used).
  -TS <assembly> <infile>
    Test-sign signed or partially signed assembly with the key pair in
    <infile>.
  -TSc <assembly> <container>
    Test-sign signed or partially signed assembly with the key pair in the key
    container named <container>.
  -v[f] <assembly>
    Verify <assembly> for strong name signature self consistency. If -vf is
    specified, force verification even if disabled in the registry.
  -Vl
    List current settings for strong name verification on this machine.
  -Vr <assembly> [<userlist>] [<infile>]
    Register <assembly> for verification skipping (with an optional, comma
    separated list of usernames for which this will take effect and an
 optional test public key in <infile>).
 <assembly>    can be specified as * to indicate all assemblies or *,<public key
 token> to
    indicate that all assemblies with the given public key token. Public key
    tokens should be specified as a string of hex digits.
  -Vu <assembly>
    Unregister <assembly> for verification skipping. The same rules for
    <assembly> naming are followed as for -Vr.
  -Vx
    Remove all verification skipping entries.
