Search and Compare
The Search operation is used to both search for and read entries. Its parameters are:

baseObject  
The DN (Distinguished Name) of the entry at which to start the search,scope  

BaseObject (search just the named entry, typically used to read one entry), singleLevel (entries immediately below the base DN), or wholeSubtree (the entire subtree starting at the base DN). 
filter  
How to examine each entry in the scope. E.g. 
(&(objectClass=person)(|(givenName=John)(mail=john*))) - search for persons who either have given name John or an e-mail address starting with john. 

derefAliases  
Whether and how to follow alias entries (entries which refer to other entries), 
attributes  
Which attributes to return in result entries. 
sizeLimit, timeLimit  
Max number of entries, and max search time. 
typesOnly  
Return attribute types only, not attribute values. 
The server returns the matching entries and maybe continuation references (in any order), followed by the final result with the result code.

The Compare operation takes a DN, an attribute name and an attribute value, and checks if the named entry contains that attribute with that value.
